#BlueMapAutoOpenMapList
- Automatically opens the map list in BlueMap when the page is loaded. 
- Simulates a mouse click after loading the list in order to make it compatible with BlueMapMapIcons as it listens for OnClick.

## Installation Instructions
Download or copy the .js file to your webapp, and register it.

### Thanks
